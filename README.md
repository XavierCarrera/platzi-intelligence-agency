<h2>About this project:</h2>

This webscraper is my project for the [Scrapy Course at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/scrapy/) 

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2>Brief description:</h2>

We use the Scrapy framework to extract declassified files from the CIA and deploy them to a HTML. The main focus of this project is to build a spider that can extract data based on Xpath expressions.
